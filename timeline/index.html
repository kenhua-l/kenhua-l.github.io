          This project is an interesting one as we were given the opportunity to conduct a
          design thinking workshop in the N-House community (post-NOC community). We came up with the syllabus
          after much consideration and because we wanted to expose the concept to those new to it as well, the
          content has been really just about the design thinking process with a lot of hands on. We would also
          like to answer the question on all the entrepreneur wannabes' mind - What is Design Thinking, really?
          Sorry, I cannot share the slides publicly because it does not solely belong to me. The above is just
          the title slide of the workshop.

        I am particularly proud of this project because it was my first actual software development
        experience and we have chosen to work on using Natural Language Processing as our challenge.
        Notice that the user can type in a natural language date (Christmas eve) and the app will
        recognize it to be 24th Dec. It is also a motivation for me to learn Natural Language Processing
        formally and hope to integrate it into future user experience project.

        This project is now taken off and not maintained since Google App Engine began charging for
        the cloud platform usage.
